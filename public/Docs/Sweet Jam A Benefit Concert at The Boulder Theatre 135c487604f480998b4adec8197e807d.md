With a longstanding history at the Boulder Theater since 1992, JamCam is proud to bring its expertise to this important cause.

**Sweet Relief i**s a charitable organization dedicated to supporting individuals in the music industry who are often hardest hit by crises.

**WaterStep** is a crucial partner in the Sweet Jam benefit, bringing their expertise in disaster response management to support Asheville's immediate and long-term water needs. Their WaterRelief program focuses on preparedness, response, and recovery, allowing them to adapt to changing needs on the ground. Recently, WaterStep responded to Asheville's request for safe water containers by sending hundreds of jerry cans, preventing the use of unsafe containers and meeting residents' urgent needs free of charge.

## Why Music?

In natural disasters, musicians are often deeply affected as their livelihoods depend on instruments, venues, and performance spaces that may be lost in these events. With this benefit concert, we seek to provide both immediate and long-term support for Asheville's music community, including artists who have lost the tools of their trade. Our aim is to restore Asheville's vibrant music scene and reinforce the role of music as a source of healing and connection.

We invite you to support this cause and help us rebuild Asheville's music community. Join us in celebrating the strength of music to heal and inspire resilience.
