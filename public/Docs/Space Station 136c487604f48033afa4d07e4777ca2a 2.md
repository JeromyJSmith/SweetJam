# Sponsorship Proposal for Space Station Dispensary

We are reaching out to you, **Space Station Dispensary**, to invite you to become one of our sponsors for **Sweet Jam: A Benefit for Asheville and Surrounding Areas**.

Space Station Dispensary has a proud commitment to community, and with *Sweet Jam: A Benefit Concert for Asheville*, we offer an impactful way to showcase it. Hurricane Helena left Asheville’s iconic music venues and gathering spaces in ruins, stripping the community of places to come together. By joining us as a sponsor, Space Station Dispensary can play a pivotal role in restoring these venues, fostering cultural resilience, and providing Asheville with the support it urgently needs to recover.

Additionally, we have partnered with **WaterStep**, a global organization active in 72 countries, which provides safe water to communities in need. WaterStep has established stations in Asheville and surrounding areas to offer clean water options, including drinking and washing stations, ensuring safe, portable water solutions for those affected. Based on current information, we understand that people in the affected area will still be in great need of water assistance when the benefit happens in early 2025.

Your sponsorship would enable us to make a real, lasting impact for those in crisis.
